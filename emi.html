                Hi guys! My name is Emigine Sisa, aka Emigine or The Box State Queen! Yes it's clear that I am a proud Colorado native born and raised in the Box State my entire life. I've traveled to numerous states and of course there's nothing like home. Except California I loveee it there! Anyways I'll tell you guys a little bit about myself and I would love for you all to continue to watch this journey with me as I build my foundation up from nothing. So tune in and welcome to my website!
            </p>
  

   <p><strong> I was born in Wheat Ridge Colorado April 15th, 1997.</strong> I have 3 older sisters who I care about dearly. They're from Indiana & North Carolina but we've all been settled in Colorado for 20 plus years.<strong> I was raised by my two amazing parents who are originally from The Democratic Republic of Congo.</strong><img src="img/cong.png" alt="" width="200" height="150">
        
        Some of our ancestors were from Portugal as well. Growing up being this kind of an African-American child had life a bit different. The mix between the African and American culture is what I feel made me into a unique artist. I love many arts! It is my passion. When I found out how much I loved poetry that was when I was in elementary school. I started writing all kinds of poetry including haikus, free verse poems just expressing what I saw at the time and did in life and then it turned into deep thoughts & internal feelings and then I started writing poems that rhymed. This turned out be my favorite style of poetry! I couldn't stop with the limericks and sonnets. Then I started writing lyrics and beatboxing in 6th grade and I just kept going from there. </p>

                    I did my first runway show! I always knew I wanted to model and create beautiful content so I went for it.My mixtape "I've Been Waiting" is about me not holding back all the talent and lyrical abilities. It's me having a good time with music and my life from a crazy perspective.</blockquote>
